# JRule Changelog

# version .6

New modules:
- JRule.ColorWheel
- JRule.GUIObject

Noteable updates: 
- configuration options have been exposed via `JRule.config`
- Caliper now allows for boxes to be "stickied" by pressing Space while measuring
- Messenger got revamped to be only a static module containing `notify` and `flash` methods (`alert` has been removed and will probably be re-implemented later as a new style of message if needed)
- Messenger.Notification and Messenger.Flash were created to provide two different message types

# version .5

This is the first version that was ever "released" and contain most of the base features in a working, but roughly put together fashion. Writing this in the future, so I just wanted to record the existence of .5.
