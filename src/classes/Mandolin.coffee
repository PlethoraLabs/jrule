# Mandolin
#
# Of course, Mandolin is empty and doesn't exist yet so there's not a whole lot to say.
# Mandolin *will be* the Slice tool for JRule. It will allow you to leave slices at custom
# spots, slice areas into fractional pieces and show preconfigured slices such as boundaries
# for a centered 960px or 1140px grid.
#
# Sounds great, right?
